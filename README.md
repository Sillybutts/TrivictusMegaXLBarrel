# Trivictus MegaXL Barrel
A barrel for MegaXL based on the Trivictus SCAR by Thanh. (Also some smooth barrels too for fun)

## Design Info

This is the MegaXL Trivictus barrel, based off the Trivictus SCAR design by Thanh. It is a barrel that uses 3 spiral lands down the length of the barrel to spin MegaXL darts real good. 

### THIS BARREL SHOULD REALLY ONLY BE USED WITH HIGH POWERED AIR BLASTERS, LIKE 4Bs AND TITANS. IF YOU WANT A BARREL FOR A SPRINGER, USE THE SMOOTH BARRELS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS LISTING.

There are 4 versions of the Trivictus barrel:
- A version that attaches to the end of a Schedule 40 / 1/2 inch PVC barrel

- A version that attaches to the end of a Schedule 40 / 3/4 inch PVC barrel

- A version that attaches to the end of a 16mm barrel (Such as 1/2in CPVC and metal barrels used for normal sized darts.)

- A blank version of the barrel for you to use in your own designs, whether that be in a harmonica clip, revolver cylinder, barrel attachment, SCAR attachment, or whatever else you come up with!


- Smooth bore barrel versions of each of these versions are also available. Versions of versions, version-ception!

## Print Info

This design needs no supports, but might need a brim depending on your printer. All STLs were exported in their print orientation.

The inside of the barrel should be sanded smooth before firing to remove any sharp edges or print artifacts.

Print time of around 3.5 hours @ 20% Gyroid, 2 wall, 70mm/s. 

Part volume: 40mm x 40mm x 121mm
